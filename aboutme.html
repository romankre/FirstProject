        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Roman, I am 20 years old, and I live in Horsens, Denmark. I currently live in a residential area in the city, which makes it easy for me to get around and manage my daily activities. I have been living in Denmark for several years and feel comfortable with the lifestyle and environment here. In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and spending time with friends. I also like taking short walks to relax and clear my mind. I have a pet cat, and I really enjoy taking care of it. Having a pet helps me relax and keeps a good balance between studying, work, and personal life. I would describe myself as a calm, friendly, and curious person. I enjoy learning new things and improving myself step by step. I value consistency, patience, and personal growth.</p>

        <p>I am a motivated and curious person with a strong interest in personal development and learning. I enjoy improving my skills step by step and always try to stay consistent in what I do. In my free time, I like to stay active by playing football, which helps me maintain discipline, teamwork, and a healthy balance between studies and leisure. I also enjoy playing computer games, especially CS2 and PUBG, as they help me relax and improve my focus, strategic thinking, and quick decision-making. I am interested in developing my programming skills and building a solid foundation in software development. My goal is to continue learning, gaining practical experience, and growing both personally and professionally through education and hands-on projects.</p>
